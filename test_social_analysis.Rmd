Load libraries

```{r, message = FALSE}
# tidyverse includes the packages readr, dplyr, ggPlot ... etc.
library(tidyverse)

# ggbeeswarm includes geom_beeswarm()
library(ggbeeswarm)

## Read in the raw data

Read in the social test raw data ([**Analysis Output-AV Social Duration.csv**](Analysis Output-AV Social Duration.csv)):

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Import social data
socialRaw <- read_csv("Analysis Output-AV Social Duration.csv", skip = 4, 
                            col_names = header)
# Look at social data
socialRaw

```

Read in the data containing the treatment and sex information for each animal (**Social Injections Data.csv**):

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Import injections data
socialInjectionsDataRaw <- read_csv("Social Injections Data.csv", n_max = 20)

# Take a look at the social injections data
socialInjectionsDataRaw
```
Read in a table that maps treatment numbers to treatment strings

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Create a dictionary for Treatment
treatmentTypeTable <- read_csv("Treatment Dictionary.csv")

# Display the table
treatmentTypeTable
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Create a dictionary for Animal Presence
animalPresenceTypeTable <- read_csv("Animal Presence Dictionary.csv")

# Display the table
animalPresenceTypeTable
```

## Combine and rearrange the data

Starting from the Social raw data, do the following: 
(TODO: UPDATE)  
    1. Combine treatment information  
    2. Add the treatment string be matching up the treatment number  
    3. Choose the column corresponding to duration with nose point and rename it  
    4. Choose the column corresponding to duration with center point and rename it  
    5. Make "TreatmentStr" a categorical variable 
    6. Make "PresenceStr" a categorical variable
    7. Compute the "AnimalIsPresent" variable
    8. Compute the "AnimalINotPresent" variable
    9. Rename "Animal Presence" as "TrialType"  
    10. Create a "TrialTypeTreatment" variable that combines "TreatmentStr" and "TrialType"  


```{r, message = FALSE}
# Rearrange the data
socialExpanded <- 
    socialRaw %>% 
    full_join(treatmentTypeTable, by = "Treatment")  %>%
    full_join(animalPresenceTypeTable, by = "Animal Presence")  %>%
    mutate(DurationNosePoint = `In zone:object 1 boundary zone/Nose-point:Duration`) %>%
    mutate(DurationCenterPoint = `In zone_3:object 1 boundary zone/Center-point:Duration`) %>%
    mutate(TreatmentStr = factor(TreatmentStr)) %>%
    mutate(PresenceStr = factor(PresenceStr)) %>%
    mutate(AnimalIsPresent = `Animal Presence`) %>%
    mutate(AnimalIsNotPresent = 1 - `Animal Presence`) %>%
    mutate(TrialType = factor(`Animal Presence`))  %>%
    mutate(TrialTypeTreatment = interaction(TreatmentStr, TrialType, sep = "-"))
  

# Take a glimpse of all the variables in the data 
glimpse(socialExpanded)
```


Remove the 26th animal because he interacted with the novel animal:

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Select all but the 26th row
socialFiltered <- 
     socialExpanded %>% filter(Trial != 25, Trial != 26)


# Take a look at the data with rows filter
socialFiltered

```


```{r, message = FALSE}
# Compute a duration ratio
socialSummarized <- 
    socialFiltered %>% 
    group_by(Tag, TreatmentStr) %>% 
    summarise(DurationRatio = sum(DurationNosePoint * AnimalIsPresent) / 
                sum(DurationNosePoint * AnimalIsNotPresent)) %>% 
    mutate(Direction = if (DurationRatio > 1) "Increased" else "Decreased")

# Take a look at the duration ratio data
socialSummarized

```


Select only the variables that will be analyzed:

``` {r, message = FALSE}
# Select variables that will be analyzed
socialData <- 
    socialFiltered %>% 
    select(Trial, TrialType, Treatment = TreatmentStr, `Animal Presence`, PresenceStr, Sex, 
           DurationNosePoint, DurationCenterPoint, Tag, TrialTypeTreatment)

# Take a look at the data with columns filtered
socialData

```


## Make plots

``` {r, message = FALSE}
# Compare two paired samples. Use ggpaired() [ggpubr] to create the paired box plot.
# ggpaired(socialData, x = "PresenceStr", y = "DurationNosePoint",
#          color = "Treatment", line.color = "gray", line.size = 0.4,
#          palette = "jco")+
#   stat_compare_means(paired = TRUE)
# 
# ```
# ``` {r, message = FALSE}
# p <- ggpaired(socialData, x = "PresenceStr", y = "DurationNosePoint",
#           color = "PresenceStr", palette = "jco", 
#           line.color = "gray", line.size = 0.4,
#           facet.by = "Treatment", short.panel.labs = FALSE)
# ```

durationPlot <-
    ggplot(socialData, aes(PresenceStr, DurationNosePoint, color = Treatment)) +
    labs(x = "Animal Presence", y = "Duration",
         title = "Social Behavior Test for Ethosuximide-treated animals")

durationPlot + geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.75, position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.3))

# p <- ggplot(socialData, aes(PresenceStr, DurationNosePoint )) +
#   geom_boxplot(aes(color = Treatment)) +
#   scale_color_manual(values = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800"))
# #p + stat_compare_means(method = "t.test")
# p
```


``` {r, message = FALSE}
#Pair the data to visualize the change between animal absent or present
ggpaired(socialData, x = "PresenceStr", y = "DurationNosePoint", id = "Tag",
  color = "PresenceStr", fill = "white", palette = "rainbow(6)", width = 0.5,
  point.size = 1.2, line.size = 0.5, line.color = "gray", title = "Social Behavior Test for Ethosuximide-treated animals - paired",
  xlab = FALSE, ylab = "Duration", facet.by = "Treatment")

ggsave("social_durationNosePoint_pairedboxplot.png")
```
``` {r, message = FALSE}
#Pair the data to visualize the change with duration ratio and treatment
durationRatioPlot <-
    ggplot(socialSummarized, aes(TreatmentStr, DurationRatio)) +
           labs(x = "Treatment", y = "Duration Animal Present:Animal Absent",
           title = "Social Behavior Test for Ethosuximide-treated Animals using Duration Ratio")

durationRatioPlot + geom_violin() +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = Direction), alpha = 0.75, width = 0.2)

ggsave("social_durationratio_jitter and violin.png")
```

## Perform Statistics

Use the Shapiro-Wilk test to test for normality

``` {r, message = FALSE}
# Test the entire data set for normality
shapiro.test(socialData$DurationNosePoint)

# Test each data set for normality
tapply(socialData$DurationNosePoint, socialData$Treatment, shapiro.test)
```

Since none of the p-values are greater than 0.05, the data sets cannot be considered normally distributed.

Therefore, we apply the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann-Whitney U test) to test for any significant difference between treatment groups.

``` {r, message = FALSE}
# Apply the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann-Whitney U test)
wTestResult <-
    wilcox.test(DurationNosePoint ~ Treatment, data = socialData)
wTestResult
```

Since the p value > 0.05, there isn't any significant difference between treatment groups.

Test for Variance

``` {r, message = FALSE}
var.test(DurationRatio ~ TreatmentStr, socialSummarized,
         alternative = "two.sided")

```

## Ratio Statistics
``` {r, message = FALSE}
# Test the entire data set for normality
shapiro.test(socialSummarized$DurationRatio)

# Test each data set for normality
tapply(socialSummarized$DurationRatio, socialSummarized$TreatmentStr, shapiro.test)
```

Since the p-values are greater than 0.05, the data sets can be considered normally distributed.

Therefore, we apply the Welch Two Sample t-test to test for any significant difference between treatment groups.

``` {r, message = FALSE}
# Apply the Welch Two Sample t-test
tTestResult <-
    t.test(DurationRatio ~ TreatmentStr, data = socialSummarized)
tTestResult

```

Since the p value is greater than 0.05, there isn't any significant difference between treatment groups.

## Conclusion

There is no significant difference between social interaction between the two treatment groups

```{r, message = FALSE}
#Old Code
# Select duration of animal presence or absence
# animalPresent <-
#       socialData$DurationNosePoint~PresenceStr
# 
# collist <- c("PresenceStr")
# sel <-apply(socialData[,collist],1,function(row) "Animal Present" %in% row)
# 
# filteredPresent <- socialData[sel,]
# filteredPresent
# 
# # animalPresent <- socialData %>% pull(DurationNosePoint.filteredPresent)
# # %>% filter(DurationNosePoint, PresenceStr == "Animal Present")
# 
# 
# # Take a look at the data with rows filter
# animalPresent
# 
# # Select duration of animalabsence
# animalAbsent <- 
#      socialData %>% select(DurationNosePoint, "Animal Presence" = 0)
# 
# # Take a look at the data with rows filter
# animalAbsent
# 
# socialData %>%
#     mutate(DurationPresenceRatio = animalAbsent / animalPresent)
# 
# animalAbsent/animalPresent
